eCommerce Sales Rank
A large eCommerce company wishes to list the best-setling products, overall and by category.
For example, one product might be the #1056th best-selling product overall but the #13th best-selling product under "Sports Equipment" and the #24th best-seiling product under "Safety."
Give a detailed description how you would design this system, explaning your thought process and reasoning in a concise way


The first thing that comes uo to my head is that we ar deailg with a filtering issue,
Every product has its ranking in a difernt category
So will have to add to each product filed "ranking_ids" an array of ranking
It will link us to another table with ranking ( id , count , category)
That way we can filter on each category the product by the ranking count
